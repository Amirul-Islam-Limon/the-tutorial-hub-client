                <h4> 1. What is cors?</h4>
                <p>CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a mechanism that allows web browsers to securely make cross-origin requests from one domain to another.</p>
                <p>CORS is an important security feature that helps protect web applications from cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</p>

                <h4> 2. Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to implement authentication?</h4>
                <p>Firebase is a comprehensive platform provided by Google that offers various services, including authentication. Developers often choose Firebase for authentication due to its ease of use, scalability, and built-in security features. Firebase Authentication provides a simple way to authenticate users using different methods such as email/password, social login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook, Twitter), and more. It handles the backend infrastructure, security, and user management, allowing developers to focus on building their applications.</p>
                <p>There are several alternatives to Firebase that you can consider for implementing authentication in your application. Here are some popular options. </p>
                <span>1. AWS Cognito</span>
                <span>2. Auth0</span>
                <span>3. Okta</span>

                <h4>3. How does the private route work?</h4>
                <p>A private route is a mechanism used in web applications to restrict access to certain routes or pages only to authenticated users. It ensures that only users who have successfully authenticated and obtained the necessary credentials can access protected or private content.</p>

                <h4>4.What is Node? How does Node work?</h4>
                <p>Node.js, commonly referred to as Node, is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server, rather than just in the browser, enabling them to build scalable and efficient network applications.</p>
                <p>Node.js operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O (input/output) model, which makes it lightweight and well-suited for handling concurrent requests and real-time applications. Here's how Node.js works:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Event Loop: Node.js utilizes an event-driven architecture with an event loop at its core. The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node to handle multiple asynchronous operations efficiently. It listens for events and executes associated callbacks when those events occur.</li>

                <li>Non-Blocking I/O: Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, such as reading from or writing to files or making network requests. When a non-blocking I/O operation is initiated, Node moves on to execute the next task without waiting for the operation to complete. This non-blocking nature enables Node to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.</li>

                <li>Single-Threaded Event Loop: Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, which means it uses a single thread to handle all incoming requests. This design choice allows Node to scale and handle many connections concurrently. Instead of creating new threads for each request, Node manages multiple requests asynchronously within a single thread.</li>

                <li>Asynchronous Programming: Asynchronous programming is fundamental in Node.js. Instead of blocking the execution while waiting for I/O operations to complete, Node utilizes callback functions or Promises to handle the results of asynchronous operations. This approach allows other operations to continue while waiting for I/O operations, improving performance and scalability.</li>

                <li>NPM (Node Package Manager): Node.js has a vast ecosystem of reusable modules and libraries available through the Node Package Manager (NPM). NPM allows developers to easily install and manage external packages to extend the functionality of their Node applications.</li>

                <li>Node.js is commonly used for building various types of applications, including web servers, RESTful APIs, real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, streaming services), command-line tools, and more. Its combination of JavaScript, event-driven architecture, and non-blocking I/O makes it a popular choice for building high-performance and scalable server-side applications.</li>
